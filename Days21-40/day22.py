Todays program will create something out of the basics. Lets tell a story today through code. 
How Artistic can you be with your programming code? Lets just have fun, relax, and code

# Todays Schedule

Stack Data Structure

definition: linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. 
LIFO - last in first out - element that was last added to stack is the first to come out
FIlO - first in first out - element that is added first is the last to come out
(termonology interchangable)

push and pop

real world examples:
    plates stacked
    standing in line

stack Functions:
    empty() - Returns whether the stack is empty - Time Complexity: O(1)
    size() - Returns the size of the stack - Time Complexity: O(1)
    top() / peek() - Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
    push(a) - Inserts the element ‘a’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
    pop() – Deletes the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
