# 100 Days of Code
This repository is to improve my skills as a developer and train myself to code daily learning how to consistently solve problems. This repository is inspired by GeeksforGeeks. I am happy to share my progress and journey while practicing to be an exceptional developer. 

This process is to help accomplish the goal of being prepared for interviews and when given an interview opportunity to excel!
