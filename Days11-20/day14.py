Todays program will create something out of the basics. Lets tell a story today through code. 
How Artistic can you be with your programming code? Lets just have fun, relax, and co\\\\

# Python Classes and Objects
class Card:
    front = "question"
    back = "answer"

    def getCard(self):
        print("I am the front of the card showing the ", self.front)
        print("I am the back of the card showing the  ", self.back)

deck1 = Card()

print(deck1.front)
deck1.getCard()

# Self Parameter
# When we call a method of this object as myobject.method(arg1, arg2), this is automatically converted by Python into MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2) â€“ this is all the special self is about. 
# self can be renamned to any other name, 

# __init__(), similar to constructor in  java. Used to initialize the obnjects state. 
# ex1
class Deck:
    def __init__(self, deck) -> None:
        self.deck = deck

    def add_card(self):
        print("You just added a card to ", self.deck)

chapter1 = Deck('Chapter1')
chapter1.add_card()

# ex2
# Sample class with init method
class Person:
 
    # init method or constructor
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
 
    # Sample Method
    def say_hi(self):
        print('Hello, my name is', self.name)
 
 
p = Person('Asa')
p.say_hi()

# Class and Instance Variables
# Instance variables are for data, unique to each instance and class variables are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class.
# Instance variables are variables whose value is assigned inside a constructor or method with self whereas class variables are variables whose value is assigned in the class.
class CreateDeck:

    # class variable
    deck = 'deck of cards'

    def __init__(self, subject, color):
        self.subject = subject
        self.color = color

BarberExam = CreateDeck("chapter1", "blue")
Part107 = CreateDeck("chapter2", "red")

print('BarberExam Details:')
print('BarberExam has a deck of', BarberExam.deck)
print('Subject:', BarberExam.subject)
print('Color:', BarberExam.color)

print('Part107 is a', Part107.deck)
